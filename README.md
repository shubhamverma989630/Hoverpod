# Martian-Harmony-3.0
_India's First Robotic Band_
# Abstract
The idea of this project is to make the India's first ROBOTIC BAND.The team is working on this project for the last three years and each year team try to construct bot that is able to play a particular instrument.In the last two years three instrument flute,drums and keyboard has been completed,so this year we have  tried to make a bot that is able to play guitar.

## Mechanical Sructure
It consist of two part:
1. Front Portion(Strumming part)
2. Rear Portion(fret part)


### Front Portion(Wooden Structure)
It consists of:
- Rectangular stand
- Cubical Structure
- Motor Support
The design consist of the 4 rectangular strips attached to the common cubical block that is further attached to the motor. The plck keys are attached to the other end of the strips.

### Rear Portion(Fret part)
Initially 4 frets(Fret 2 to Fret 5) were chosen and each fret consist 6 strings so total 24 ,notes the team has tried to cover.With these 24 notes we are able to play major chords of the guitar (C major,G major,A minor, E major, A major,D etc and many more).
For each note one linear actuator is used which is controlled with the help of motor drivers. Between linear actuator and string a see-saw structure has been constructed to press the corresponding string.

###  Final Changes and Modification in design
The sturture became very sophisticated due to less space and more compnent, so we try to reduced our mechanical design .At the end we found out that with the help of just 10 notes of first four frets we are able to play 7  chords of the guitar and hence the covering of 24 notes is useless.

 ## Working
 Chords has been pressed with the help of linear actutor that are controlled using motor drivers.The strumming portion is restricted to single pattern having feedback mechanism with the help of IR sensor to  avoid time delay and friction opposed on the pluck keys by the strings.
 # Limitations
 - At present we are able to cover only 10 notes. It is good if we are able to imcrese it.
 - Single strumming pattern can be done. We can't make changes in strumming pattern.
 - Current cumsumption is very high due to lineaar actuators.
 - Lead notes can't be played.
 # Future Improvements
 - To increase the number of notes covered.
 - To do variation in strumming pattern.
 - To play lead notes of the song.
